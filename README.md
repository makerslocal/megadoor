ATmega or ESP firmware for ldap-to-door control.

More documentation is hosted on the [Makers Local Wiki](https://256.makerslocal.org/wiki/Megadoor).

### What is this?

It's firmware for an ATmega. When the system encounters a valid NFC tag, it will toggle a relay that is bound to an unlock button on our door's electric deadbolt.
